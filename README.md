# Dynamic suspension system
 
ESP32 Active Suspension System with MPU-6050 & Servo Control
This project implements an active suspension system using an ESP32, MPU-6050 accelerometer, and four servos. The system dynamically adjusts servo positions based on real-time motion data to stabilize a platform.

Features:
- Real-time motion sensing with MPU-6050
- Low-pass filtering for smooth servo movements
- Gradual servo transitions to avoid sudden jumps
- Button-controlled modes to switch between default, raised, and lowered positions

Perfect for robotics, vehicle suspension simulations, or balancing mechanisms!
